## Overview
As an Internet Service Provider (ISP), ensuring a clean and secure email experience for customers is crucial. In this project, we focus on improving the email filtering system by developing and evaluating two supervised machine learning models for spam detection. Our goal is to accurately identify spam emails and prevent them from cluttering customers' inboxes.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather a labeled dataset containing email features (e.g., subject, sender, content).
   - Clean and preprocess the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose two classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.
   - Understand their strengths and weaknesses for spam detection.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train both models on the training data.
   - Evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Model Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of the logistic regression and random forest models.

## Expected Outcomes
- A well-documented project with code, visualizations, and explanations.
- Insights into which model (logistic regression or random forest) performs better for spam detection.
  
## Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can enhance email security, reduce false positives, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
